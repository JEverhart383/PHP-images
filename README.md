# PHP-images

This is a simple file upload form using PHP. It checks for a few image types and then upload the image, if a correct format, to an already created /images folder in the current directory. 
There is also some mySQL DB stuff in here that is not connected or necessary for the image upload to work. Most is commented out. 

## Thing to do 
Work on error handling. It's not tight at all right now.
